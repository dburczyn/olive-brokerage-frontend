prerequisites:
latest version of npm

clone repository/extract zip file
open command prompt/windows powershell/terminal inside project folder

npm install
adjust config for database connection (set user/pass/port/host as env variables) or
type it in database.json
note, one of the configurations is the name of the database.
This should be created beforehand (for example using pgadmin gui, that comes default with postgres installation)
Obviously, database uset set in config has to have all the rights to the database
run:
npm run build
npm run production
by default, your application will run on localhost, port 1337 and
your admin dashboard woud be avilable at:
http://localhost:1337/admin
obviously, above is configurable in server.json (host and port)
now, after accessing admin panel, you can create your administrator account.
If you would like to use migration package to see example content, now is the time,
when database is empty - just run provided sql commands on the database you created
Regardless, set user permissions to view content, that you would like to display
As a default, you should set permission to 'find' and 'findone' for all public roles
for all predefined content types.
